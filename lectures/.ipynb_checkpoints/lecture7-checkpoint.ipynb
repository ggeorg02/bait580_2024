    "\n",
    "We already understand this query from the last class, but understanding how the graph engine performed this traversal can help write an efficient CQL query.\n",
    "\n",

    "MATCH (follower:Person)-[:FOLLOWS]->(reviewer:Person)-[:REVIEWED]->(m:Movie)\n",

    "### Specifying multiple MATCH patterns\n",
    "\n",

    "MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),\n",
    "(m)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)\n",
    "WHERE m.released = 2000\n",
    "RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "When multiple patterns are specified in a MATCH clause, no relationship is traversed more than once.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also specify the above query using a single pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "WHERE m.released = 2000\n",
    "RETURN a.name, m.title, d.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why multiple match patterns? \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though both queries mentioned above mean the same, there are situations when you can't represent it in a single match pattern, especially when looking at complex queries. For e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to retrieve the movies that Meg Ryan acted in and their respective directors and the other actors that acted in these movies. Here is the query to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH (meg:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person),\n",
    "(other:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)\n",
    "WHERE meg.name = 'Meg Ryan'\n",
    "RETURN m.title as movie, d.name AS director , other.name AS `co-actors`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You can specify aliases or column headings using AS; you will be seeing it a lot in all upcoming queries.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "It's a good practice to use AS wherever you can, as it can guide your thoughts and print results in a meaningful way.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple MATCH clauses,\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH (valKilmer:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)\n",
    "MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)\n",
    "WHERE valKilmer.name = 'Val Kilmer'\n",
    "RETURN m.title as movie , actor.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also write the same using multiple patterns,\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH (valKilmer:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),\n",
    "(actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)\n",
    "WHERE valKilmer.name = 'Val Kilmer'\n",
    "RETURN m.title as movie , actor.name as `Actor name`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A best practice is to traverse as few nodes as possible so in this example, using multiple MATCH patterns is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Usually, the multiple MATCH clauses are used when dealing with Subqueries using WITH. We will discuss it soon.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "(nodeA)-[:RELTYPE*]->(nodeB) \n",
    "//Retrieve the paths of length 2 with the relationship, :RELTYPE from nodeA to nodeB:\n",

    "Experiment with the below query by varying depths, and see how it behaves.\n",

    "WHERE follower.name = 'Paul Blythe'\n",
    "RETURN p.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we want to retrieve the paths of lengths 1, 2, or 3 with the relationship, :RELTYPE from nodeA to nodeB, nodeB to nodeC, as well as, nodeC to _nodeD) (up to three hops):\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(nodeA)-[:RELTYPE*1..3]->(nodeB)\n",
    "```\n",

    "WHERE follower.name = 'Paul Blythe'\n",
    "RETURN p.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the shortest path\n",
    "\n",
