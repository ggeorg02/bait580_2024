    "## 3 Vs of Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you come across any big-data article, you will hear about V's. 3V ’s definition was introduced in 2001 by Gartner Inc. analyst Doug Laney. After this, it evolved a lot with many other V's. Here I will be going through more common 3V's discussed in today's industry. The 3 V's are, broadly speaking, Velocity, Volume, and Variety. These were introduced to help understand the challenges of Big Data in computing and analytics.  The concepts are broadly applicable across all disciplines—for example, check what my colleague wrote about [big data in Ecology](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biy068).  Various datasets or problems are affected differently by each of the different axes, so understanding the different dimensions of big data is critical to finding the analytic solutions we intend to apply.\n",

    "Other people have spoken about five Vs ([Value](https://bizibl.com/marketing/download/fifth-v-big-data)), [seven Vs](https://impact.com/marketing-intelligence/7-vs-big-data/) (adding Variability, Visualization and Value), and even more.  If you want to know more V's ( 42 of them ) and add your vocabulary, you can check out [this](https://www.elderresearch.com/blog/the-42-vs-of-big-data-and-data-science/) article. These additional V's can be informative, but, by and large, the Four V's provide the most insight into data challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's checkout 3 V's in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "<img src = 'img/volume.png'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "When we think about \"Big Data, \" this is often the most familiar dimension.  We think of Big Data in terms of gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes.  The volume presents a significant challenge for data storage, although modern technology has reduced this challenge to some degree.  It also produces a challenge for recall (simply finding information) and for data processing (transforming and analyzing data). Here are the pointers to look out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How big is the data?\n",
    "- Total File Size\n",
    "- Number of Data Points\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud storage solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "But in most cases, it's not just about storing your data; it's more about how you will process the data. Then there will be limitations by read-write access or/and memory capacity.\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "<img src = 'img/volumesolu.png'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Partitioning/Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "We must look at this from different angles, partitioning/sharding from a database perspective, which we will touch upon later in this course. Another option is to go for distributed file system where it stores data in small blocks so that it's easy to process when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel processing \n",
    "\n",
    "Small chunks of files can be processed simultaneously by using different servers/cores and aggregate results at the end. This is mainly made possible in the industry by high-performance/cluster computing or other map-reduce-based frameworks like Hadoop/spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Velocity\n",

    "Velocity is a second factor.  We may be interested in only the most recent data, minutes or seconds, requiring low volumes of data, but at a high velocity.  For example, quant traders might be using high-frequency stock data to maximize trading profits.  This involves analysis with extremely fast turnover. Here are the pointers to look out for:\n",

    "  - Annual data from Stats Can?\n",
    "  - Real-time data from stock tickers or Twitter?\n",

    "## The 3 V's and Analytic Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges come to the forefront when we're working with data.  The goto standard is to open up an Excel or read in a comma-separated file to look at the data, get a sense of what is happening, or summarise the key elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*  When that file is <10MB in size, that's often not a big problem, but as files get bigger and bigger, even calculating a simple mean is an issue (**Volume**).\n",
    "*  When the data contains text, images, values in different currencies, summary becomes problematic (**Variety**)\n",
    "*  When the 10MB you just summarized are out-of-date, as soon as you're done outlining them, how do you present these results to your colleagues? (**Velocity**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Based Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these challenges have straightforward(ish) solutions, but how we apply those solutions and our choices are often specific to the problem we are trying to answer.  For example, a common solution people present to **Volume** is to use a NoSQL database to store and index information.  This is an appropriate solution in many cases; however, most data is well suited to relational databases, and these often provide advantages over non-relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important steps in choosing how to set up your analytic workflow is the proper framing of your question.  This will help you understand:\n",
    "\n",

    "  2. How you will transform that data ?\n",
    "  3. How you will represent your data ?\n",

    "### Scale UP\n",
    "\n",
    "***With cloud computing, a scale-UP solution is just one click away;*** before the rise of cloud computing, it was considered very difficult as it had to be done in an on-premise setup. As a student, you can think about buying a new 32 GB RAM laptop when things don't work anymore in your 16 GB laptop. You can, of course, think about all the difficulties involved in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a scale-UP solution sounds easy with cloud computing, it might not be appropriate in many situations, especially when dealing with big data. Here are some of the disadvantages you can think of with a scale-UP solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No default high availability\n",
    "- Single point failure\n",
    "- Server upgrade can be tricky (I agree with cloud computing, it is easy !)\n",
    "- No upper limit with hardware capacity \n",
    "- Downtime related to upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale OUT\n",
    "\n",
    "Add more computers so that it behaves as a single machine. Many scale OUT solutions are available, like cluster computer, HPC, Hadoop, Spark etc... Our focus will be on the Scale UP solution. In our last class on special topics, I will briefly touch upon some more details on the scale OUT solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize;\n",
    "A scale-UP solution makes more sense when thinking about just an individual working on some data on a research project. However, looking from a large scale or an enterprise solution standpoint, a scale-UP solution is not a great option in most cases as there is always an expectation of huge and steady growth in data in the long run. So, let's get into the details of a scale-OUT solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding some advantages related to the scale-OUT solution;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scale-out is easy - as you want to add servers when the load is high, and you can remove servers when the load is less.\n",
    "- You can make use of distributed frameworks and it's advantages for processing\n",
