    "## Let's Normalize\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a table of relations. These redundancies in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. Normal forms are a certain set of defined rules to \"break a table smartly\" to create normalized tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storytime:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted Codd introduced the concept of normalization and first normal form in his [paper](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf) in 1970, which provides theoretical foundation of designing a database. After a year, he defined 2nd and 3rd normal form in [this](https://forum.thethirdmanifesto.com/wp-content/uploads/asgarosforum/987737/00-efc-further-normalization.pdf) paper. Later in 1974, Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF). These 4 normal forms are considered the most common or important ones; Most database systems are designed to follow the 3rd normal form or BCNF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later came some more restrictive normal forms (4NF,5NF,6NF), but these are mainly used for theoretical purposes and are less implemented in industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We explain the normal forms in an easier-to-understand fashion, and they can also be explained using theoretical formulas and derivations.\n",
