    "Check out [this article](https://www.wired.com/2015/11/how-instagram-solved-its-justin-bieber-problem/) to know why I am here!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the right tool for the job. So far, we’ve used RDBMS appropriately by normalizing it, using indexes wherever needed & denormalizing it for analytical and dashboard purposes. Postgres or any other database ( like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server) can support very large operations. Instagram, IMDB, Skype, and others use Postgres for business-critical services. But, SQL is not suited to all analyses. Here is what happened with Instagram - how Justin Beiber's popularity could destroy the entire infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even around 2013, Instagram already had a pretty big infrastructure, and they used to use Postgres as their database. Everything was going well until Justin Beiber got into Instagram. He was one of the first high-profile people to get on Instagram. When he would post something, people would comment and like him so much. But people around the globe are doing it simultaneously that it is hitting servers so fast that people can't see their likes or comments, or it took a long time for that to get updated as a result of [locking tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/explicit-locking.html). After so much debugging to this issue, Instagram decided to move to a hybrid system with Amazon Cassandra and Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway message from this story is that even though they had a big infrastructure on Postgres, no other techniques really worked out to solve this problem. And they want to rely on a hybrid solution ( Postgres and Cassandra) to this problem. Most data systems are hybrid in the era we are in; you will experience this when you start working in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a (semi) standard language (SQL) across all platforms.\n",

    "## Disadvantages of RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write times and table locks reduce efficiency\n",
    "    - Particularly when the upsert level is high (UPDATE & INSERT)\n",
    "- Some data has complex models\n",

    "[Here](http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/nosql/Home%20Page) checkout the real NoSQL from 1998.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not (Only) SQL) was there for quite a while now. It was first introduced in 1998 by [Carlo Strozzi’s](http://www.strozzi.it/users/carlo/vitae.html) to call his lightweight, relational database that did not follow the standard SQL interface, and hence NoSQL. Later in 2000, this got popular as hashtag #NoSQL to discuss the advancement in the non-relational database world. It's a trendy buzzword these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Goals of NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce the dependence on fixed data schema.\n",
    "- Reduce the dependence on a single point of truth.\n",
    "- Scaling!\n",

    "\n",
    "- (semi) Schema-free\n",
    "  - With no referential integrity and internal consistency, we can easily split data across servers\n",
    "- Accepting Basic Availability:\n",

    "### Different types of NoSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key–value store\n",
    "\n",
    "In these kinds of databases, data is stored as key-value pairs. You can think of it as a giant dictionary object. In these cases, the database will contain a simple, unique string as the key, and that key will point to a large data value. The data value can be stored as an integer, a string, or a complex structure. This database is based on the Amazon Dynamo [paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document store\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of key-value DB with internal (searchable) structure. A “document” contains all relevant data and has a unique key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: ElasticSearch, MongoDB, AWS DocumentDB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column based\n",
    "\n",
    "Column-based databases are built based on google's big table [paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). Our normal files and relational databases store data in the disk in a row based fashion, but here data is stored in a column-based fashion. Efficiency comes in filtering when a few columns are needed.\n",
