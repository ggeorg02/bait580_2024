# Overview first week installations and setup.

```{note}
Disclaimer: Dealing with all these installations may be challenging if you are not from an IT background. Therefore, I have created this PPT to guide you through the slides in a sequential order. You will also find various sources for assistance, including our lectures, videos, or tutorials, or a combination of all three. Hopefully, we will all navigate through this week smoothly.
```
