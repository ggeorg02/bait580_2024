    "# Using psycopg2 package\n",
    "\n",
    "Let first install the package using [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/psycopg2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "%%sh\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda psycopg2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's make sure that we can import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import psycopg2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we have `psycopg2` imported into our notebook. `psycopg2` package manages the interaction between python and our database. So the first takeaway message here is that psycopg2 has nothing to do with jupyter notebook; rather, it's tied to python. So we use jupyter notebook as an interactive programming environment to query in python. Later if time permits, we will talk about `SQL magics,` which is a specific way of interacting with databases from jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay! Let's now get to the steps to connect to a database using psycopg2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Create a connection*** \n",
    "\n",
    "    This connection allows communication with the database; It opens up a network connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Create a cursor***\n",
    "\n",
    "    The cursor is an address for the memory on the database management server to say this is what we are looking at. This python object helps you execute the query and fetch the results from the database. You can read more about cursors [here](https://medium.com/dev-bits/understanding-postgresql-cursors-with-python-ebc3da591fe7).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Formulate your query***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formulate the SQL query that you want to execute in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Execute***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pass your query to execute() method of cursor object, run the query in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Fetch/commit/rollback***\n",
    "\n",
    "    The query that we performed in execute doesn't return the query right away. To return it, we need to perform a fetch. If the query is to write something, then we need to commit it. If some transaction went wrong, then we need to roll back it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now check out these by creating a ticker table, loading data to it, and doing some querying. Let's first create schema import,\n",
